# Beam Animations Viewer

This project renders four beam animation GIFs in a single full-page 2x2 layout.

`index.html` is styled to:
- Keep everything visible in one screen (no page scrolling).
- Use a light seamless background that blends with white image backgrounds.
- Remove dark card borders/backgrounds so the GIFs appear cleaner on the page.

## View the page

From this folder, open the file in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

You can also double-click `index.html` in Finder to view it.
